Networks of tennis matches

This repo contains `igraph` network objects for the matches played in WTA or ATP over the recent decades.
The ties in the networks are between players, with the sender being the winner of the match and the receiver being the loser.

This allows a researcher to study the on-court interaction among professional tennis players using social network analysis tools.

The matches are very richly annotated and lots of player and match attributes are included.

These graphs are 100% based on the data that Jeff Sackmann has so painstakingly collected over the years. The raw data can be found [here for the WTA games](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_wta) and [here for the ATP games](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp). 

I am obliged to Jeff for this brilliant work.
